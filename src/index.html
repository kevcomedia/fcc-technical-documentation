    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <dfn>JavaScript</dfn> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
      language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
      environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
      the objects of its environment to provide pragmatic control over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
      <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core
      set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
      statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
      supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>).
          For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
          elements on an <abbr>HTML</abbr> form and respond to user events such
          as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What you should already know</h2>
    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
        (<abbr>WWW</abbr>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of
        the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
      in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
      Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follow most Java
      expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
      which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
      declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number
      of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript
      has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based
      object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that
      is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
      supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
      can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have
      to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be
      concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
      do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function
      return types are not explicitly typed.
    </p>

    <h2>Hello world</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code></pre>
    <p>
      Select the code in the pad and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to watch
      it unfold in your browser!
    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
      names of variables, called <dfn>identifiers</dfn>, conform to certain
      rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore
      (<code>_</code>), or dollar sign (<code>$</code>); subsequent characters
      can also be digits (<code>0-9</code>). Because JavaScript is case
      sensitive, letters include the characters <code>"A"</code> through
      <code>"Z"</code> (uppercase) and the characters <code>"a"</code> through
      <code>"z"</code> (lowercase).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as <code>å</code> and
      <code>ü</code> in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
      sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
      <var>Number_hits</var>, <var>temp99</var>, and <var>_name</var>.
    </p>

    <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>

    <p>With the keyword <code>var</code>. For example,</p>
    <pre><code>var x = 42;</code></pre>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>

    <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
    <pre><code>x = 42;</code></pre>
    <p>
      This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
      warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
    </p>

    <p>With the keyword <code>let</code>. For example,</p>
    <pre><code>let y = 13;</code></pre>
    <p>
      This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
      Variable scope below.
    </p>

    <h2>Global variables</h2>
    <p>
      Global variables are in fact properties of the global objects. In web
      pages the global object is <code>window</code>, so you can set and access
      global variables using the <code>window.<var>variable</var></code> syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
      frame from another window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
      <var>phoneNumber</var> is declared in a document, you can refer to this
      variable from an iframe as <var>parent.phoneNumber</var>.
