    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <dfn>JavaScript</dfn> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
      language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
      environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
      the objects of its environment to provide pragmatic control over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
      <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core
      set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
      statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
      supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>).
          For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
          elements on an <abbr>HTML</abbr> form and respond to user events such
          as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
